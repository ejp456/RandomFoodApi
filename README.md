<h1>Random Food API<h1>
This is a small project I created to play with the Yelp API, Oauth RESTful requests, and Spark Java
The project is a small restful service that allows requests of the form ?term="search query"?location="desired location".
A request to this API will return an object that contains a random restaurant
